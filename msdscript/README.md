#MSDScript

MSDScript is a simple scripting language developed in during graduate education at the University of Utah. It was developed using C++ and is powerful enough to handle mathematics, boolean 
expressions, and functions. As you may notice, the print functionality does not print in a very visually appealing manner. due to time constraints, the 'pretty print' functionality of MSDScript was 
dropped though you may see some it's remnants in the code.
MSDScript began as a command line tool but was eventually incorporated into a gui using QT creator. I hope you enjoy using the application.
